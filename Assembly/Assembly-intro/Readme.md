Solidity enables the use of inline assembly, which allows developers to create low-level code that directly interacts with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This feature provides greater control and flexibility over a contract's behavior. However, it's important to note that inline assembly comes with increased risks and should be used cautiously. When used appropriately, assembly can help optimize gas costs and enable advanced functionalities that are not achievable with pure Solidity code.

The basic structure of Solidity inline assembly is as follows:
```
assembly {
 // Assembly code goes here
}
```
Within the assembly block, EVM instructions can be written using a syntax similar to other assembly languages.

Move code is organized into modules that are uploaded to the Aptos blockchain. Users can interact with the modules by calling functions from these modules via transactions. Modules are grouped into packages. When uploading code to the blockchain, an entire package of multiple modules will be uploaded. 


An empty module looks like below:
```
module 0xcafe::my_module {

}
```
